# How to use the program

Required for program to work properly:
PIL (Pillow) Python module, Python 3.6 or newer

For the program to convert your image to the icon (.ico) file, just drop the image into the PNG folder and run the Python file.
All image files that are inside will be converted to .ico files and saved in ICO folder once the program runs. Original files that were converted will be deleted from the PNG folder.
