# How to use the program

PIL (Pillow) Python module is required for program to work,
Python 3.6 or newer

For the program to convert your image to the icon (.ico) file, just drop the file into the program's folder and run the Python file.
All image files that are inside will be converted to .ico files once the program runs.
Program won't cause any duplicate files unless you tinker with the name of the files. If you do want to rename the files, make sure to rename both converted and preconverted file to the same name so there would be no duplicates created in the future.
