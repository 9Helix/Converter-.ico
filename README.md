# Note

PIL (Pillow) Python module is required for program to work

For the program to convert your image to the icon (.ico) file, just drop the file into the program's folder.
All image files that are inside will be converted to .ico files once the program runs.
Program won't cause any duplicate files unless you tinker with the name of the files.
